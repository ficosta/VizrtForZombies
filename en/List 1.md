# Vizrt for Zombies

This is the first exercise list based on the basic introduction to scripting for vizrt.
For most of the challenges just a little mathematics and a basic knowledge of programming and logic is required. 
But don't limit yourself to this, go further and add visuals but don't increase the complexity. A perfect balance between code "effort" and design is what we want to achieve!

1. Write a script that takes two integers and prints the sum of these two numbers
2. Write a script that reads a value in meters and displays it converted to millimeters
3. Write a script that reads the user's number of days, hours, minutes and seconds. Calculate the total in seconds.
4. Make a script that calculates a salary increase. It should ask for the amount of the salary and the percentage of the raise. Display the amount of the raise and the new salary.
5. Request the price of a commodity and the discount percentage. Display the discount amount and the final price.
6. Calculate the time for a car trip. Ask the distance to be traveled and the expected average speed for the trip.
7. Convert a temperature entered in Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula is F = 9*C/5 + 32
8. Now do the opposite, from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
9. Write a script that asks for the number of km traveled by a car rented by the user, as well as the number of days for which the car was rented. Calculate the price to pay, knowing that the car costs $ 30.00 per day and $ 0.15 per km driven.
10. Write a script to calculate the life span reduction of a smoker. Ask  how many cigarettes he smokes per day and how many years he has smoked. Consider that a smoker loses 10 minutes of life with each cigarette, calculate how many days of life a smoker will lose. Display the total days.
11. Knowing that Cstr( ) converts numeric values to string, calculate how many digits there are in 2 to the nearest million.
