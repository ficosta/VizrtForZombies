# Vizrt for Zombies

This is the second and more complex exercise list based on the basic introduction to scripting for vizrt.
For most of the challenges just a little mathematics and a basic knowledge of programming and logic is required. 
But don't limit yourself to this, go further and add visuals but don't increase the complexity so much. A perfect balance between code "effort" and design is what we want to achieve!

1. Make a script that asks for the three sides of a triangle. The program should tell you whether the values can be a triangle. If the sides form a triangle, indicate whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
2. Determine if a year is leap. Check on Google how to do this...
3. John The-Fisher-King, a good man, bought a microcomputer to control the daily yield of his work. Every time he brings in a fish weight bigger than the established by the fishing regulation of the Hanbourg city (max. 50 kilos) he must pay a fine of $4.00 per excess kilo. John needs you to make a program that reads the variable weight (fish weight) and check if there is excess. If there is an excess, write in the text excess and in the text fine the amount of the fine that John must pay. Otherwise show these variables with the content $0.
4. Make a script that reads three numbers and displays the largest of them.
5. Make a script that reads three numbers and displays the largest and smallest of them.
6. Make a program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. Calculate and show the total of your salary for that month, knowing that 11% is deducted for income tax, 8% for social insurance, and 5% for the union, make a program that gives us the gross salary, how much you paid to social insurance, how much you paid to the union, and the net salary. Note that Gross Wage - Deductions = Net Wage. Calculate the discounts and the net wage according to the table below:
    - a. + Gross Wage : $
    - b. - income tax (11%) : $
    - c. - social security (8%) : $
    - d. - union ( 5%) : $
    - e. = Net : $
7. Make a script for a paint store. The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to to be painted. Consider that the coverage of the paint is 1 liter for every 3 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18 liter cans, which cost $ 80,00. Tell the user the quantities of cans of paint to be be purchased and the total price. Note: only a whole number of cans are sold.
